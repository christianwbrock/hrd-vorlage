# Using the Hertzsprung-Russell-Diagram to teach the scientific method

The content of this repository is pretty much described by the title above.

In our observatory (www.sternwarte-goennsdorf.de) I was asked to tell some younger children
aged 11-13 something about the *sun and stars*. I thought about it for some time, and then
I came up with the idea to tell them about how the scientific method works using the HRD.

I used some Python code to generate an empty HRD,
and then I did some more code to create a list of stars with their temperature and luminosity.

The day come and went by, and it went pretty well.
*I hope the kids liked it as much as I did ;-)*

Afterward I set down again refining the material and wrote some instructions for others.
Of course, this  took much longer than the original code.
And this is how this repository came to life.

**So, why did I spend the extra work writing it down?**

As Thomas Eversberg once said:

    If you don´t write it down, it's ĺike you never did it.
